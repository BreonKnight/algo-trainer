    - Select different monsters to search for
    - See the jump search process step by step
    - Adjust jump size and see its impact
    - Learn about territory organization
    
    Common Mistakes:
    - Incorrect jump size calculation
    - Not checking block boundaries
    - Skipping territories during jumps
    - Forgetting to search within block
    
    Optimization Tips:
    - Choose optimal jump size based on territory count
    - Keep track of previous jump position
    - Use efficient monster identification
    - Consider territory characteristics
